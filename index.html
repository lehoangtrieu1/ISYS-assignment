            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm currently a student studying Business Information Systems at Curtin University. My journey into web development started during my first years when I saw my friend to create his website.</p>
            <p>Curious to see how websites were built, I began experimenting with HTML and CSS, creating simple web pages for fun.</p>
            <p>My journey into web development started with a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript tutorial, and since then, I've been continuously learning and honing my skills through Classes. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve problems and create meaningful user experiences.</p>
            <p>Now, as a student pursuing a career in this field, I'm excited to apply my skills and creativity to build engaging and innovative web experiences. I believe that web development offers endless opportunities for learning, growth, and occupation.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to sharing my projects and continuing to grow as a developer!</p>
